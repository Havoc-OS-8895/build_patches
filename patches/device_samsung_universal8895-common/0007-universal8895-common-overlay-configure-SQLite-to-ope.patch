+         From https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_synchronous:
+         WAL mode is safe from corruption with synchronous=NORMAL, and probably DELETE mode is safe
+         too on modern filesystems. WAL mode is always consistent with synchronous=NORMAL, but WAL
+         mode does lose durability. A transaction committed in WAL mode with
+         synchronous=NORMAL might roll back following a power loss or system crash.
+         Transactions are durable across application crashes regardless of the synchronous setting
+         or journal mode. The synchronous=NORMAL setting is a good choice for most applications
+         running in WAL mode.
