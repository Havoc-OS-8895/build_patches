# My custom LineageOS build patches

## How to apply

Clone this repo to the source root folder, then run following command

```
bash patches/apply-patches.sh patches
```

## Notes

* This repo is meant to be used with my [local manifest](https://github.com/diepquynh/local_manifests/tree/lineage-17.1-8895). Please use it before applying the patches (this is highly recommended for any non-LOS/LOS-based ROMs building)
* After applying the patches, you can freely adapt the patched device trees to your own ROM taste
* There are several whitespace errors while patching. They can be ignored
